# Counting component for VQA

![Overview of what the method accomplishes](cats.png)

This is the official implementation of our ICLR 2018 paper [Learning to Count Objects in Natural Images for Visual Question Answering][0] in [PyTorch][1].
In this paper, we introduce a counting component that allows VQA models to count objects from an attention map, achieving state-of-the-art results on the number category of VQA v2.

The core module is fully contained in [`counting.py`][3].
If you want to use the counting component, that is the only file that you need.

Check out the README's in the `vqa-v2` directory for VQA v2 and `toy` directory for our toy dataset for more specific information on how to train and evaluate on these datasets.

## Single-model results on VQA v2 test-std split

As of time of writing, our accuracy on number questions is state-of-the art for single *and* ensemble models.
The accuracy on the overall category is, as far as we know, the second best among single models (see [MFH][4]), though our approach is complementary to theirs.

Yes/No | Number | Other | All
--- | --- | --- | ---
83.56 | **51.39** | 59.11 | 68.41


UPDATE: With this year's VQA Challenge, our number results are no longer SotA.
However, [Bilinear Attention Networks][5] use this counting component with their improved attention model and get 54.04% on the number category, which is the new SotA on the number category.
This validates our claim that a better attention model should lead to further improvements in counting through our counting module.
