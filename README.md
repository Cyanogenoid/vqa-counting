# Counting component for VQA

![Overview of what the method accomplishes](cats.png)

This is the official implementation of our ICLR 2018 paper [Learning to Count Objects in Natural Images for Visual Question Answering][0] in [PyTorch][1].
The core module is fully contained in [`counting.py`][3].
If you want to use the counting component, that is the only file that you need.

Check out the README's in the `vqa-v2` directory for VQA v2 and `toy` directory for our toy dataset for more specific information on how to train and evaluate on these datasets.
